            <h1>review</h1>
            <p>I started to use Github, which is a tool to let your repository make public.
                I uploaded it and i realized my repositories include many personal information so I started to create new ones while i am reviewing what I was learning so far.
                While I am doing it, I am thinking if i wanna be a web designer or at least something related to coding or teacher or professor. I never know where my future is going which i like but also being scared a little.
